## 1. Door pull adaptor

**Hypothesis**

**_There's no good reason why all doors shouldn't be 'contactless' or at least minimal contact._** 

-> As a first step, focus on high traffic doors where the majority of traffic for a building passes through. 

**Example:**

1. My apartment block is in a courtyard with a front gate where 3 blocks of people pass through requiring a pull handle to exit (high traffic)
2. My actual block (25 flats) has an entrance door - entering the requires a pull handle (medium traffic).
3. Then theres either the lift (press buttons) or stairs (requires at least one pull handle) (low traffic).
4. Then my front door which is a more complicated twist handle (low traffic i.e. only me).

Everyone might use the same toilet door in an office. 

**Existing solutions**

- Automatic doors 
- Foot pull doors e.g. https://www.stepnpull.co.uk/
- Alternative arm door handle e.g. https://www.akitchen.com/store/hands-free-sanitary-door-opener.html

**Criticism of existing solutions**

- Automatic doors are ideal but are expensive and hassle to retrofit if not already in place. It's unfeasible that every door can be automatic.
- Both foot and alternative arm doors are pretty expensive and require permanent and strong fixings to the door. Great if you own the building, but might be a problem to install quickly, temporarily or at scale.
